# Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer
## Problem Statement
Given an integer number n, the task is to return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

## Hint
The key to solving this problem efficiently lies in breaking down the integer into its individual digits and then computing the product and sum of those digits separately.

### Example
Example 1:

Input: n = 234

Output: 15 

Explanation: 

Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 

Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 

Result = 24 - 9 = 15
